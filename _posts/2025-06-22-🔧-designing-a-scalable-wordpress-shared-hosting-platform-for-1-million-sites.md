## üß≠ Problem Statement

Shared hosting is the default for most WordPress websites ‚Äî but traditional approaches don‚Äôt scale well. We need a system that can:

* Support **millions of WordPress sites**.
* Keep **resource usage low**.
* Make **updates and maintenance easy**.
* Be **highly available**, **secure**, and **cost-effective**.

- - -

## üß± Architecture at a Glance

### üîπ Separation of Compute and Storage

* **Compute Layer:** Stateless pods (NGINX + PHP-FPM) serve content.
* **Storage Layer:** Shared **CephFS** filesystem stores all WordPress content.
* **Database Layer:** Multi-tenant **Neon PostgreSQL** serverless databases for each site, with **PgBouncer** for connection pooling.

### üîπ Read-Only vs Read-Write Access

* **Read-Only Pods:** Serve user traffic (frontend, visitors)  
* **Read-Write Pods:** Handle admin actions (uploads, plugin installs)

### üîπ Symlink-Based Core Versioning

* WordPress core is shared across all sites using **symlinks**  
* Changing the core version is as easy as updating a symlink

- - -

## üìÅ CephFS: Scalable, Shared Storage

We use **CephFS**, a POSIX-compliant distributed filesystem, to store:

* WordPress core versions (e.g. `/shared/wordpress-core/v6.2/`)  
* Each site‚Äôs unique content (`wp-content/`, media, themes, plugins)  
* All sites under a unified namespace (e.g. `/mnt/cephfs/sites/`)

**Benefits:**

* Shared access across many Kubernetes nodes  
* High availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance  
* Easy to manage millions of directories (one per site)

- - -

## üîÑ Symlink-Based WordPress Core

Instead of copying WordPress core for each site, we:

* Keep shared core versions centrally:
  		`
  		/shared/wordpress-core/v5.9/
  		/shared/wordpress-core/v6.2/
  	
  		
* Point each site‚Äôs `public_html/wp` folder as a **symlink** to one of the versions:
  		`bash
  		ln -sfn /shared/wordpress-core/v6.2 /mnt/cephfs/sites/foo.com/public_html/wp
  		
  	

**Why this rocks:**

* Upgrades are instant: just change the symlink
* Rollbacks are safe and fast
* Saves huge amounts of storage
* No impact to custom content or plugins

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Layer with Neon PostgreSQL

Managing millions of databases is no small feat. To handle this at scale, we use **Neon**, a serverless, multi-tenant PostgreSQL service built for massive workloads.

**How it works:**

* **Multi-Tenant by Design:** Neon allows to create separate databases (or schemas) for each WordPress site, providing strong data isolation and security. Each site‚Äôs domain is mapped to its dedicated Neon database automatically.
* **Connection Pooling with PgBouncer:** To prevent Neon from being flooded with thousands of short-lived connections, we run **PgBouncer**, a lightweight connection pooler. It reuses and multiplexes connections efficiently, keeping the database layer stable under high concurrency.
* **Auto-Provisioned `wp-config.php`:** During site creation, provisioning system automatically generates a standard `wp-config.php` file for each site, injecting the correct Neon database name, user, password, and host. This keeps things simple and fully compatible with WordPress and its plugins ‚Äî no special hacks needed.
* **Dynamic Resolver:** Our Domain Resolver Service not only maps domains to storage paths but also returns the database connection details for the corresponding site, so PHP-FPM connects to the right Neon instance or schema on every request.

**Benefits:**

* Strong tenant isolation
* Minimal connection overhead
* Easy scaling with Neon‚Äôs serverless architecture
* Simple and consistent database management

## üåê Handling Domains Dynamically

With millions of domains, we can't maintain 1 million NGINX configs. So we created a **Domain Resolver Service**:

* Accepts a domain (e.g., `foo.com`)
* Returns the site‚Äôs root directory (e.g., `/mnt/cephfs/sites/foo.com/public_html`)
* Also returns the Neon database connection details
* Used by NGINX and PHP-FPM to serve the right content and data dynamically

- - -

### üì¶ NGINX + PHP-FPM in Action

1. **NGINX receives request** for `foo.com`
2. Calls the **Domain Resolver API**
3. Sets `$document_root` based on the resolved path
4. Forwards PHP requests to **PHP-FPM** with correct `SCRIPT_FILENAME`

- - -

## üöÄ Performance & Scaling

To handle scale and optimize performance:

* Use **FastCGI Cache** in NGINX for dynamic pages
* Integrate with a **CDN** (like Cloudflare) for static assets
* Deploy **stateless read-only pods** for scaling frontend serving
* Isolate **admin pods** to handle writes safely
* Offload connection handling to **PgBouncer** and Neon‚Äôs built-in pooling

## üß™ Next Steps

Want to build this yourself? Start with:

1. Deploying **CephFS with Rook** on Kubernetes
2. Setting up **NGINX + PHP-FPM** with CephFS mounts
3. Creating a lightweight **Domain Resolver API**
4. Automating **symlink management** for WordPress core
5. Provisioning **Neon projects/databases** via API
6. Running **PgBouncer** for connection pooling
7. Implementing **FastCGI caching** and CDN optimization

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

This architecture lets you serve **millions of WordPress sites** with strong isolation, efficient upgrades, and low overhead ‚Äî all without reinventing the wheel.

If you're building large-scale hosting platforms or cloud-native WordPress infrastructure, this approach gives you the flexibility of containerization with the robustness of traditional hosting ‚Äî at serious scale.
